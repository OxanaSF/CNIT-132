  My life as a web developer, has been pretty much amazing! I started developing
  web pages when there was no CSS to be used and all formatting was done using HTML tags that currently are considered
  deprecated or even eliminated from good web developed pages. One example of tags that have been eliminated are: <span class="red_underline">&lt;font&gt;, &lt;center&gt;</span>. There are some attributes that have been also eliminated in order
  to clean more the HTML code and put all the formatting (style) to CSS.
</p>

<h2>
  Using CSS
</h2>

<p>
  When CSS was created, the main idea was exactly to take all of these formatting
  tags and attributes from the HTML document and transfer them to an external file that would only take care of
  formatting the HTML page. The idea is that the HTML document should be focused on the content of the page and the
  formatting, even layout, would be in a separated file.
</p>

<p>
  Whis standard has been supported and adopted world wide by W3C (<span class="red_underline">World Wide Web Consortium</span>) which is the organization that sets the standards for web development.

 End of this exercise
</h2>

<p>
  At the end of this exercise, you will take all of these bad attributes and
  formatting tags that are taking too much space in this HTML document and you will create an <span class="red_underline">embedded
    CSS</span> using the <span class="red_underline">&lt;style&gt; tag</span> (of course, placing this tag in the appropriate
  section of your document). Within that style tag, you will transfer all the formatting you see in this page and create
  appropriate CSS in order to clean the HTML document without changing the formatting that this old style HTML has
  created!

<p>
Tis a link to <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu">City College web site</a>. After you
  visit this page, this link should be white due to the vlink attribute in the body tag. If you have never visited this
  link, then, it will be red due to the link attribute in the body tag as well.
